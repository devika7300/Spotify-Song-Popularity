## üåü Introduction

The "Follower-Based Song Popularity Prediction" project aims to predict song popularity on Spotify by using machine learning techniques and various song characteristics. Our model uses features like **artist popularity**, **follower count**, **danceability**, **energy**, **acousticness**, and more to predict which songs are likely to become hits. We explore multiple machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to identify the most accurate model for song popularity prediction.

This project provides essential insights into the music industry, offering a way for artists and producers to enhance marketing strategies, optimize release schedules, and maximize listener engagement.

## üîç Problem Statement

Predicting song popularity is a challenging task, as many factors contribute to whether a song becomes a hit. In this project, we address the following problem:

- **Goal**: To predict song popularity using a comprehensive set of features such as artist popularity, follower count, and song attributes (danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, etc.).
- **Objective**: Provide actionable insights to artists, producers, and record labels to optimize marketing efforts and release strategies.

---

## üí° Approach

The project follows a structured approach to predict song popularity:

1. **Data Collection**: Spotify API is used to gather data on song attributes such as danceability, energy, loudness, and artist details like popularity and follower count.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Raw data is cleaned, normalized, and processed to handle missing values and irrelevant features. This includes selecting relevant features, removing duplicates, and standardizing numerical and categorical data.
3. **Model Development**: Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees and KNN are trained on the preprocessed dataset. The models are optimized through cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
4. **Model Comparison**: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the most accurate model is selected for song popularity prediction.

## üåç Significance

This project offers significant value to the music industry by providing predictive insights that can influence marketing and production strategies. The model helps:

- **Artists & Producers**: Optimize release schedules and marketing campaigns by predicting which songs are likely to become hits.
- **Record Labels**: Make data-driven decisions on resource allocation for promoting specific songs or artists.
- **Global Scalability**: The model can be adapted to predict song popularity across different genres, regions, and markets, making it a valuable tool for global music analytics.

## üìä Data

### a. Data Gathering
- Data is collected from Spotify‚Äôs API, focusing on features like artist popularity, follower count, and various song attributes.
- This data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of song popularity.

### b. Data Preparation
- Data cleaning involves removing irrelevant features, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent data formats.
- Numerical features such as **danceability** and **energy** are normalized, and categorical features such as **artist country** are standardized.

### c. Data Preprocessing
- Features like **track ID** and **song name** are removed as they do not contribute to prediction accuracy.
- Duplicates are handled, and a dataset without null values is created for the model development phase.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations to explore data relationships.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for training and testing the models.
- **Google Colab**: The development environment where the models are trained and evaluated.

---

## üìà Proposed Models

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- The KNN algorithm is applied to predict song popularity based on its similarity to other songs.
- The model's performance is optimized by adjusting the number of neighbors and evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

### 2. Decision Tree Regressor
- A Decision Tree model is trained to predict song popularity based on features like **danceability**, **energy**, and **acousticness**.
- The model's complexity is controlled through hyperparameters like `max_leaf_nodes` and `min_samples_split`, and its performance is measured using RMSE.

---

## üß† Challenges and Learnings

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant features was critical for ensuring data quality.
- **Feature Selection**: Determining which features contributed most to predicting song popularity was a key aspect of model development.
- **Model Optimization**: Tuning the hyperparameters of the models to balance accuracy and overfitting was challenging but essential for improving performance.

---

## üîÆ Future Work

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Incorporating deep learning models to improve the accuracy of predictions.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Expanding the model to predict song popularity in real-time.
- **Broader Data Integration**: Incorporating additional data sources, such as social media sentiment and concert ticket sales, to enhance the model‚Äôs predictive power.
